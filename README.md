It will be updated as fixes/updates are released. For now it supports Newegg, Best Buy and B&H.

## Why use the app?

The app will provide the fastest notifications available. It is free to use, with some paid tiers in order to support its development (a developer costs about $50-$100 the hour). You get full customization of your alerts up to the SKU. And the stock will open automatically on your browser if you enable it. That means you are not slowed down by your reaction time.

The app uses the notion of Cooperative Stock Crawling. We are all helping each other by checking websites for stock. You, me, everyone who has the app will check websites at a reduced rate. Usually checking a website every 5 min or more. Making it extremely hard to be detected as a bot since we are crawling at extremely slow pace locally. But the trick is that all the clients are connected through an ultra-fast low latency network, so that if any of us finds stock, then we can alert the others of said stock and we can ALL benefit. Hence the notion of Cooperative.

Is this slower than just have the user check every second or quicker? No. Since we are thousand of users of the app!

4. You will also be redirected to the user portal at https://my.stockdrops.net/usersetup create an account, or use a Microsoft account. (But remember which one you choose!). And then click on Set Up User Account at the top right! It's important to do this. We need your User Agent to properly browse like you. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20151415/118373453-bbb10200-b56b-11eb-9797-bf9f3c4e34e0.png).

6. You are good to go on the setup at this point. So click "Done" in the app.
7. The app should open now a page where you can login for the app on your default browser. It's important to do this step with the SAME ACCOUNT YOU CREATED IN THE PORTAL!

If you signed up with an email, then use the SAME email here, or the setup will fail complaining that it cannot read your User Agent (what you saved in step 4).
8. Then you can proceed to the app's alert settings:

### Common Failures or issues

There's a few issues that we have seen that can happen. And we will address here and tell you how to address them.

The first one is the URLs not opening in the browser. This is usually a registry key missing on your PC, and it's as easy to fix as to reset your default browser by going into the default apps.

And choosing your default browser again in the list.
